      Everything comes full circle, but what if for once, someone takes a
      different path or treads differently? Altering this combination of arcs
      can lead to something phenomenal that we haven’t seen yet. Something
      different, yet awe inspiring. ‘Altering Arcs’ is what the Theme for
      TEDxSIESGST is all about this year. We intend to bring forward
      thought-provoking stories and inspiring journeys of those who have
      chosen the less traveled path and tweaked the conventional process,
      dodging every stumbling block thrown their way.<br /><br />

      Encouraged by the saying, “Winners don't do different things. They do
      things differently”, this year's theme inspires us to understand that,
      Strength and growth comes only through continuous effort, struggles and
      these experiences that you undergo, 'Alters' your story, your perception
      of things, of the characters around you, in conclusion Yourself!<br /><br />

      “Fighting will push you through, surrendering will bury you deep. Both
      these things will happen in your mind but will affect your life
      deeply.”<br /><br />

      Growth, improvement and adversities are the constant in the arc of life,
      be ready to take it all in and do what's right for you. When you alter
      the path, you will create the life that is most true, and unique- to
      you. Be brave enough to choose a path you believe in, make plans for the
      future and gear up to face what life has to offer.
